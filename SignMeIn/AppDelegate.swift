// TODO:
// 1. Change the TVC to a VC and show the instructor
//      1.1 Class info and check in code
//      1.2 The option to change check in code
//      1.2 The option to change class info (Optional)
// 2. Add VC to the second tab for users to change their first and last name
// 3. Move logout button to the second tab bar
// 4. Add a few more alerts to check in page to propt the user what's wrong
